# Roadmap

Where the project stands and what may come next. Items under **Ideas** are not commitments —
they are the things most likely to be picked up, in roughly that order.

## Done

- Taskbar bar with CPU, RAM, GPU, disk and network sections, plus CPU/GPU temperature
- Fixed-width value slots and availability latches, so the layout never jumps when a value
  changes width or a sensor drops out for a tick
- Content-driven bar width, measured per frame (correct under PerMonitorV2 DPI)
- History overlay with eight charts over the last ~120 samples
- Smoothed disk/network dual bars — EMA plus an auto-scaling full-scale value, recalibrated
  when the poll interval changes
- Tray icon with tooltip and context menu
- Appearance settings applied live: theme, opacity, font scale, section visibility, poll
  interval, °C/°F
- Position persistence, including recovery when the saved spot is no longer on screen
  (`WM_DISPLAYCHANGE`)
- Always-on-top via z-order in `WM_WINDOWPOSCHANGING` rather than a `SetWindowPos` loop
- Single-instance guard (named mutex)
- Elevation without a per-launch UAC prompt, via a scheduled task (`deploy/Install.ps1`)
- LibreHardwareMonitorLib 0.9.6 with the signed PawnIO driver instead of WinRing0
- Unit tests for all of `Core`; CI builds and tests on `windows-latest` with warnings as errors

## Ideas

**Distribution**
- Prebuilt binaries on GitHub Releases, so users do not need the .NET SDK
- Self-contained publish as an alternative to the framework-dependent one
- Code signing, to avoid the SmartScreen warning

**Monitoring**
- CPU/GPU clock speeds
- VRAM usage in the bar (`SensorData` already carries it; only the overlay uses it today)
- Picking a specific disk or network interface instead of aggregating all of them
- Per-core CPU load in the overlay

**Behaviour**
- Auto-hide over fullscreen apps (games, video)
- Threshold notifications
- Exporting history to CSV/JSON

**Code**
- Extract an `ISensor` interface once a third sensor family justifies it
- Localisation, if there is demand for languages other than English
